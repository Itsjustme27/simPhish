üõ†Ô∏è Development
Key Features Implementation
Password Strength Tracking
php
// Real-time password compliance monitoring
'password_meets_requirements' => $passwordStrength['meets_requirements'],
'password_strength_details' => json_encode($passwordStrength['details']),
Event-Driven Bot Simulation
php
// Probability-based victim simulation
$event = new BotLaunched($message, $subject);
event($event);
$result = $event->result; // Realistic success/failure scoring
Advanced Threat Detection
php
// Pattern-based email analysis
$suspiciousPatterns = [
    '/http[s]?:\/\/[^\s]+/i',                // Links
    '/(verify|confirm|reset).{0,20}(account|password)/i', // Phishing intent
    '/urgent|suspended|locked/i',            // Social engineering
];
